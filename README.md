Hell
====

Hell is an open source build system written in HaskEL-Lua.

Hell aims to being simple to script, yet very flexible,
but not letting go of the speed.

It's use is based on _Builders_ for any kind of stuff, that can be created or
modified on the fly very easily, which brings flexibility and extensibility.

For more info, check out the _\*Design\*_ files, they explain the whole idea (in pt\_BR).
